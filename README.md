Dima, I have this project done specially to increase your self-esteem by laughing at my shitty code i do
There are all options of solving 2- equalations in rational numbers. 
By the way, D<0 also has a solution, as i was told on algebra lessons ;)
When are you arriving in St.Petersburg? It's pretty boring city with a lot of snow and bad transport system, i almost hate it. I would rather visit Khabarovsk and live on streets.
